I'm Luis Mata, a Scientific Engineer with expertise in AI research and development. My passion for graph theory, cognitive sciences, metaheuristics, and natural language has driven my career in developing cutting-edge AI solutions. Through my experience in academic research groups of international excellence and industry, I have gained a solid foundation in scientific methodology and the ability to analyze and synthesize complex information.

My technical skills include data science, deep learning R&D, and model design using libraries and frameworks such as Scikit-Learn, Numpy, CUDA, Tensorflow, Pytorch, PySpark, NetworkX, and more. I'm also skilled in Linux, shell scripting, and network programming and have experience using boto3 to interface with AWS services. Additionally, I have experience using Docker, Airflow, Celery, MLFlow, and Kubernetes to build and deploy machine learning models and data pipelines.

I'm currently working as a Senior ML Engineer at Fujitsu's CoE of Advanced Analytics in Madrid, Spain, where I specialize in Graph Machine Learning Engineering. I'm always looking to collaborate on interesting AI projects and learn from other professionals in the field.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmataa/) or explore my Github repositories to learn more about my work.
